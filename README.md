## Overview

This is a simple, interactive browser version of Noughts and Crosses, built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

### Gameplay

At the start of each round, or when the board is reset, the player who goes first will be chosen at random.

Players take turns to place noughts (player one) or crosses (player two) until one of them scores three in a row.

If neither player can achieve three in a row, the round ends in a draw.
